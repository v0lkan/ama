# Ask me anything!

## [Ask a question](https://github.com/v0lkan/ama/issues/new) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Read answered questions](https://github.com/v0lkan/ama/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)

I get a lot of questions by email but responding to an email only helps one person. This way anyone can read the answer.

**If you'd rather not ask your question publicly**, send me an [email](mailto:me+ama@volkan.io) and I can post the question anonymously for you.

Subscribe for updates by [watching the repo](https://github.com/v0lkan/ama/subscription).

Anything means anything: Personal questions. Money. Life. Code. Whatever.

#### Guidelines

- Ensure your question hasnâ€™t already been answered.
- Use a succinct title and description.
- Be civil and polite :)

#### Disclaimer

##### Answers from me

All questions are welcome but not all questions will be answered by me. 
And not all questions will be answered in a timely manner. 
Some questions may not be answered at all.


To increase the likelyhood of me answering your question it should:

- Be relevant to me or my opinions in some way and not something anyone could answer (those are better served by [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), etc).
- Be helpful or interesting for other people. I prefer this medium to email because my time spent answering these questions helps more people. Answers that only help the asker are not an efficient use of my time and may not be answered.


#### Other contact mediums

I can also be reached on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/linkibol) and [email](mailto:me+ama@volkan.io), but I prefer [this medium](https://github.com/v0lkan/ama/issues/new).
